Note that, if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.\n      \n      The Multi-Object Delete operation supports two modes for the response; verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses\n      verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response\n      includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error.

However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as data source for the part your are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object you use the Upload Part (Copy) operation. For more information, see Upload Part - Copy.\n        You must initiate a multipart upload (see Initiate Multipart Upload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.\n        Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.\n        To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.\n        Note: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\n      headers: \n        Content-Length: \n          description: |\n            The size of the part, in bytes.

for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.\r\n\r\nYou set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability.\r\n\r\nTo enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncorsPayload =\r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\"\r\n+\"<CORSConfiguration>\"\r\n+  \"<CORSRule>\"\r\n+    \"<ID>Rule_1</ID>\"\r\n+    \"<AllowedOrigin>http://www.example.com</AllowedOrigin>\"\r\n+    \"<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>\"\r\n+    \"<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>\"\r\n+    \"<ExposeHeader>x-amz-server-side-encryption</ExposeHeader>\"\r\n+  \"</CORSRule>\"\r\n+\"</CORSConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncorsUpdateResponse = client.put(corsPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",corsPayload, {cors:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( corsUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturns the cors configuration information set for the bucket.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:GetBucketCORS action.\r\nBy default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncorsResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{cors:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( corsResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeletes the cors configuration information set for the bucket.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutCORSConfiguration action.\r\nThe bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncorsDeleteResponse = client.delete(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\",null,{cors:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( corsDeleteResponse.status, 204 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the tagging subresource to add a set of tags to an existing bucket.\r\n\r\nUse tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and Tagging in About AWS Billing and Cost Management.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutBucketTagging action.

An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated, using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.\r\n\r\nThis operation returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria, the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker and upload-id-marker request parameters.\r\n\r\nIn the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuploadsResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{uploads:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( uploadsResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCreates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration action. By default,\r\nthe bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nIf your bucket is version-enabled or versioning is suspended, you cannot add a lifecycle configuration.\r\n\r\nIf you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them\r\npermissions for the following actions:\r\n* s3:DeleteObjec\r\n* s3:DeleteObjectVersion and\r\n* s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration\r\n\r\nIf you want to block users or accounts from managing lifecycle configurations, you must deny permission\r\nfor the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration action.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlifeCyclePayload =\r\n \"<LifecycleConfiguration>\"\r\n+  \"<Rule>\"\r\n+    \"<ID>archive-objects-glacier-immediately-upon-creation</ID>\"\r\n+    \"<Prefix>glacierobjects/</Prefix>\"\r\n+    \"<Status>Enabled</Status>\"\r\n+    \"<Transition>\"\r\n+      \"<Days>0</Days>\"\r\n+      \"<StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>\"\r\n+    \"</Transition>\"\r\n+  \"</Rule>\"\r\n+\"</LifecycleConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlifecycleUpdateResponse = client.put(lifeCyclePayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",lifeCyclePayload, {lifecycle:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( lifecycleUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket.\r\n\r\nTo use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration action.

You set the bucket's Region using the LocationContraint request parameter in a PUT Bucket request. For more information, see PUT Bucket. To use this implementation of the operation, you must be the bucket owner.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlocationResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{location:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( locationResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDeletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket.

To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have\r\na valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets.\r\nBy creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.\r\n\r\nNot every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets.\r\n\r\nBy default, the bucket is created in the US Standard region. You can optionally specify a region in the request body.\r\nYou might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside\r\nin Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the EU (Ireland) Region.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\nIf you create a bucket in a region other than US Standard, your application must be able to handle 307 redirect.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific\r\npermissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.\r\n\r\n* Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header.\r\n* Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp,\r\n  x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly.

For more information, go to Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket,\r\nyou must have WRITE_ACP permission.\r\n\r\nYou can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:\r\n* Specify the ACL in the request body\r\n* Specify permissions using request headers\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.\r\n\r\nDepending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or\r\nthe headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body,\r\nthen you can continue to use that approach.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nOWNER = extractTagValue(bucketsListResponse.body,\"Owner\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclPayload = \r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"<AccessControlPolicy>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+    OWNER + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"</AccessControlPolicy>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclUpdateResponse = client.put(aclPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",aclPayload, {acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the acl subresource to return the access control list (ACL)\r\nof a bucket. To use GET to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have READ_ACP access to the bucket.\r\nIf READ_ACP permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without\r\nusing an authorization header.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the DELETE operation deletes the bucket named in the URI.

operation uses the logging subresource to set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and modify the logging parameters. To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.\r\n\r\nThe bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the Grantee request element to grant access to other people. The Permissions request element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nloggingPayload = \r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\"\r\n+\"<BucketLoggingStatus xmlns=\\\"http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01\\\">\"\r\n+\"</BucketLoggingStatus>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nloggingUpdateResponse = client.put(loggingPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",loggingPayload, {logging:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( loggingUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the logging subresource to return the logging status of a bucket and the permissions users have to view and modify that status. To use GET, you must be the bucket owner.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nloggingResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{logging:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( loggingResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the notification subresource to enable notifications of specified events for a bucket. Currently, the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event is the only event supported for notifications. The s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event is triggered when Amazon S3 detects that it has lost all replicas of an object and can no longer service requests for that object.\r\n\r\nIf the bucket owner and Amazon SNS topic owner are the same, the bucket owner has permission to publish notifications to the topic by default. Otherwise, the owner of the topic must create a policy to enable the bucket owner to publish to the topic. For more information about creating this policy, go to Example Cases for Amazon SNS Access Control.\r\n\r\nBy default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with s3:PutBucketNotification permission.\r\n\r\nAfter you call the PUT operation to configure notifications on a bucket, Amazon S3 publishes a test notification to ensure that the topic exists and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to the specified topic. If the notification is successfully published to the SNS topic, the PUT operation updates the bucket configuration and returns the 200 OK response with a x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to topic.\r\n\r\nTo turn off notifications on a bucket, you specify an empty NotificationConfiguration element in your request: <NotificationConfiguration />\r\n\r\nFor more information about setting and reading the notification configuration on a bucket, see Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events. For more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnotificationPayload = \"<NotificationConfiguration></NotificationConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnotificationUpdateResponse = client.put(notificationPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",notificationPayload, {notification:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( notificationUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the notification subresource to return the notification configuration of a bucket. Currently, the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event is the only event supported for notifications. The s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event is triggered when Amazon S3 detects that it has lost all replicas of a Reduced Redundancy Storage object and can no longer service requests for that object.\r\nIf notifications are not enabled on the bucket, the operation returns an empty NotificatonConfiguration element.\r\nBy default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification configuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration with the s3:GetBucketNotification permission.\r\nFor more information about setting and reading the notification configuration on a bucket, see Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events. For more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnotificationResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{notification:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( notificationResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the requestPayment subresource to set the request payment configuration of a bucket. By default, the bucket owner pays for downloads from the bucket. This configuration parameter enables the bucket owner (only) to specify that the person requesting the download will be charged for the download. For more information, see Requester Pays Buckets\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequestPaymentPayload =\r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\"\r\n+\"<RequestPaymentConfiguration xmlns=\\\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\\\">\"\r\n+  \"<Payer>BucketOwner</Payer>\"\r\n+\"</RequestPaymentConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequestPaymentUpdateResponse = client.put(requestPaymentPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",requestPaymentPayload, {requestPayment:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( requestPaymentUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the requestPayment subresource to return the request payment configuration of a bucket. To use this version of the operation, you must be the bucket owner. For more information, see Requester Pays Buckets.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequestPaymentResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{requestPayment:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( requestPaymentResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nSets the configuration of the website that is specified in the website subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, go to Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.\r\n\r\nThis PUT operation requires the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwebsitePayload =\r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\"\r\n+\"<WebsiteConfiguration xmlns=\\\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\\\">\"\r\n+  \"<IndexDocument>\"\r\n+    \"<Suffix>index.html</Suffix>\"\r\n+  \"</IndexDocument>\"\r\n+  \"<ErrorDocument>\"\r\n+    \"<Key>404.html</Key>\"\r\n+  \"</ErrorDocument>\"\r\n+\"</WebsiteConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwebsiteUpdateResponse = client.put(websitePayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",websitePayload, {website:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( websiteUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation returns the website configuration associated with a bucket.\r\nTo host website on Amazon S3, you can configure a bucket as website by adding a website configuration.\r\n\r\nThis GET operation requires the S3:GetBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can read\r\nthe bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the website configuration\r\nby writing a bucket policy granting them the S3:GetBucketWebsite permission.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwebsiteResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{website:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( websiteResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 200 OK response upon\r\nsuccessfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a 200 OK response if\r\nthe website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 404\r\nresponse if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.\r\n\r\nThis DELETE operation requires the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner\r\ncan delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users\r\npermission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the\r\nS3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwebsiteDeleteResponse = client.delete(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\",null,{website:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( websiteDeleteResponse.status, 204 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the policy subresource to add to or replace a policy on a bucket. If the\r\nbucket already has a policy, the one in this request completely replaces it. To perform this operation,\r\nyou must be the bucket owner.\r\n\r\nIf you are not the bucket owner but have PutBucketPolicy permissions on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed.\r\nIn all other cases for a PUT bucket policy request that is not from the bucket owner, Amazon S3 returns 403 Access Denied.\r\nThere are restrictions about who can create bucket policies and which objects in a bucket they can apply to.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nAWS_ACCOUNT_ID = prompt(\"Please, enter your AWS Account ID.

To use this operation,\r\nyou must have GetPolicy permissions on the specified bucket, and you must be the bucket owner.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have GetPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're\r\nnot the bucket owner, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error. If the bucket does not have a policy, Amazon S3 returns a 404\r\nPolicy Not found error.

new bucket in the US Standard region\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclient.put(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see Upload Part). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.\r\nNote: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuploadsCreateResponse = client(\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY).post(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"POST\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,null,{uploads:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( uploadsCreateResponse.status, 200 )\r\nuploadId = extractTagValue(uploadsCreateResponse.body,\"UploadId\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts. To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the List Parts operation and ensure the parts list is empty.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncancelUploadResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).delete(null,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,null,{uploadId: uploadId}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( cancelUploadResponse.status, 204 )\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nCR\r\n```\r\n\r\nLets start another upload.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuploadsCreateResponse = client(\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY).post(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"POST\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,null,{uploads:\"\"}))\r\nuploadId = extractTagValue(uploadsCreateResponse.body,\"UploadId\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation uploads a part in a multipart upload.\r\nNote: In this operation you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as data source for the part your are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object you use the Upload Part (Copy) operation. For more information, see Upload Part - Copy.\r\nYou must initiate a multipart upload (see Initiate Multipart Upload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.\r\nPart numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.\r\nTo ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.\r\nNote: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuploadPartPayload = \"API Notebook test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\npartUploadResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).put(\r\n  uploadPartPayload,\r\n\tgenerateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,uploadPartPayload,{partNumber:1,uploadId : uploadId})\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( partUploadResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncompleteUploadPayload =\r\n \"<CompleteMultipartUpload>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<Part>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+    \"<PartNumber>\" + 1 + \"</PartNumber>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+    \"<ETag>\"+ partUploadResponse.headers.etag + \"</ETag>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</Part>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"</CompleteMultipartUpload>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuploadIdUploadIdCreateResponse = client(\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY).post(completeUploadPayload\r\n,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"POST\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,completeUploadPayload,{uploadId : uploadId}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( uploadIdUploadIdCreateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nList objects of the bucket\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use GET, you must have READ access to the object.\r\nIf you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.\r\n\r\nAn Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however,\r\ncreate a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an\r\nobject sample.jpg , you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg.\r\n\r\nTo get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual\r\nhosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as\r\n/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in\r\nthe bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg.\r\n\r\nTo distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs using BitTorrent.\r\n\r\nIf the object you are retrieving is a GLACIER storage class object, the object is archived in Amazon Glacier. You must firs\r\nrestore a copy using the POST Object restore API before you can retrieve the object. Otherwise, this operation returns\r\nInvalidObjectStateError error.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nretrieveObjectHeaders = generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY)\r\nretrieveObjectHeaders.headers[\"If-Modified-Since\"] = \"Thu, 09 Oct 2013 20:46:48 GMT\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//Not supported. Response has application/json Content-Type and a plain string (instead of json object or array) as content. Notebook is not capable of processing such responses.\r\n//objectResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).get(null, retrieveObjectHeaders)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//assert.equal( objectResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you are interested\r\nonly in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object.\r\n\r\nA HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object. The response is identical to the GET response except that\r\nthere is no response body.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nobjectHeadResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).head(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"HEAD\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( objectHeadResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.\r\n\r\nAmazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.\r\n\r\nAmazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the\r\nlast object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application\r\nlayer or use versioning instead.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks\r\nthe object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while\r\nputting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nTo configure your application to send the Request Headers prior to sending the request body, use the 100-continue HTTP status code.\r\nFor PUT operations, this helps you avoid sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (e.g., because of\r\nauthentication failure or redirect).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nobjectUpdateResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).put(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( objectUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the torrent subresource to return torrent files from a bucket. BitTorrent can save you bandwidth when you're distributing large files. For more information about BitTorrent, see Amazon S3 Torrent.\r\n\r\nNote\r\nYou can get torrent only for objects that are less than 5 GB in size and that are not encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption key.\r\nTo use GET, you must have READ access to the object.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntorrentResponse = client(\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY).get(null,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,null,{torrent:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( torrentResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the acl subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of an object.\r\nTo use this operation, you must have READ_ACP access to the object.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclResponse = client(OBJECT_KEY).get(null,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,null,{acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for an\r\nobject that already exists in a bucket. You must have WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object.\r\n\r\nYou can use one of the following two ways to set an object's permissions:\r\n* Specify the ACL in the request body, or\r\n* Specify permissions using request headers\r\n\r\nDepending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers.\r\nFor example, if you have an existing application that updates an object ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nOWNER = extractTagValue(bucketResponse.body,\"Owner\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclPayload = \r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"<AccessControlPolicy>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+    OWNER + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"</AccessControlPolicy>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclUpdateResponse = client(OBJECT_KEY).put(aclPayload,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY,aclPayload,{acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DELETE operation removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the lates\r\nversion of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects.\r\nTo remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the versionId subresource. Using this subresource permanently\r\ndeletes the version. If the object deleted is a Delete Marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, x-amz-delete-marker, to true.\r\n\r\nIf the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the\r\nx-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nobjectNameDeleteResponse = client.objectName(OBJECT_KEY).delete(null,generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\"+OBJECT_KEY))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( objectNameDeleteResponse.status, 204 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nGarbage collection. Delete the test bucket.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclient.delete(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\"))\r\n```","filePath":"notebooks/amazonS3Bucket/objectsPartOne.md","repo":"AmazonS3"},{"path":"/virtual/AmazonS3/notebooks/amazonS3Bucket/objectsPartThreeRestoration.md","content":"---\r\nsite:

You can optionally provide version ID to restore specific object version. If version ID is not provided, it will restore the current version.\r\n\r\nIn the request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy. Note that the object remains archived; Amazon S3 deletes only the restored copy.\r\n\r\nAn object in the Glacier storage class is an archived object. To access the object, you must first initiate a restore request, which restores a copy of the archived object. Restore jobs typically complete in three to five hours.\r\n\r\nFor more information about archiving objects, go to Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain restoration status by sending a HEAD request. In the response, these operations return the x-amz-restore header with restoration status information.\r\n\r\nAfter restoring an object copy, you can update the restoration period by reissuing this request with the new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request, and there are no data transfer charges.\r\n\r\nYou cannot issue another restore request when Amazon S3 is actively processing your first restore request for the same object; however, after Amazon S3 restores a copy of the object, you can send restore requests to update the expiration period of the restored object copy.\r\n\r\nIf your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PUT Bucket lifecycle.\r\n\r\nTo use this action, you must have s3:RestoreObject permissions on the specified object. For more information, go to Access Control section in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrestorePayload = \"<RestoreRequest><Days>1</Days></RestoreRequest>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrestoreResponse =

To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have\r\na valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets.\r\nBy creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.\r\n\r\nNot every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets.\r\n\r\nBy default, the bucket is created in the US Standard region. You can optionally specify a region in the request body.\r\nYou might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside\r\nin Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the EU (Ireland) Region.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\nIf you create a bucket in a region other than US Standard, your application must be able to handle 307 redirect.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific\r\npermissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.\r\n\r\n* Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header.\r\n* Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp,\r\n  x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketPayload = \"\"\r\n//As we use a standard US region, we leave the request payload empty. Otherwise, we would use XML similar to:\r\n//   \"<CreateBucketConfiguration>\"\r\n//  +  \"<LocationConstraint>EU</LocationConstraint>\"\r\n//  +\"</CreateBucketConfiguration>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketCreateResponse = client.put(bucketPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",bucketPayload))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( bucketCreateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request.\r\nTo authenticate a request, you must use a valid AWS Access Key ID that is registered with Amazon S3.\r\nAnonymous requests cannot list buckets, and you cannot list buckets that you did not create.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketsListResponse = servicesClient.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,null,null,true))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( bucketsListResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation returns some or all (up to 1000) of the objects in a bucket.\r\nYou can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket.\r\n\r\nTo use this implementation of the operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( bucketResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nHEAD Bucket\r\nThis operation is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The operation returns a\r\n200 OK if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it. Otherwise, the operation might return responses such\r\nas 404 Not Found and 403 Forbidden.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketHeadResponse = client.head(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"HEAD\",\"/\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( bucketHeadResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the acl subresource to set the permissions on an existing\r\nbucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, go to Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket,\r\nyou must have WRITE_ACP permission.\r\n\r\nYou can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:\r\n* Specify the ACL in the request body\r\n* Specify permissions using request headers\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.\r\n\r\nDepending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or\r\nthe headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body,\r\nthen you can continue to use that approach.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nOWNER = extractTagValue(bucketsListResponse.body,\"Owner\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclPayload = \r\n \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"<AccessControlPolicy>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+    OWNER + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</Owner>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"<AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+  \"</AccessControlList>\" + \"\\n\"\r\n+\"</AccessControlPolicy>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclUpdateResponse = client.put(aclPayload, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"PUT\",\"/\",aclPayload, {acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclUpdateResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the GET operation uses the acl subresource to return the access control list (ACL)\r\nof a bucket. To use GET to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have READ_ACP access to the bucket.\r\nIf READ_ACP permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without\r\nusing an authorization header.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naclResponse = client.get(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"GET\",\"/\",null,{acl:\"\"}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( aclResponse.status, 200 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the DELETE operation deletes the bucket named in the URI. All objects (including all object versions and Delete Markers)\r\nin the bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nbucketDeleteResponse = client.delete(null, generateHeadersAndQuery(\"DELETE\",\"/\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nassert.equal( bucketDeleteResponse.status, 204 )\r\n```","filePath":"notebooks/amazonS3Services/bucketsPartThree.md","repo":"AmazonS3"},{"path":"/virtual/AmazonS3/portal/amazonS3Bucket/api.md","content":"### Welcome to the RAML API portal for the

For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).\n\n#Considerations\n\n- In order to run this notebooks you will need an Amazon S3 account. Each notebook prompts you to enter your Access Key and Secret Key. These credentials can be found at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) in the section named \"Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)\".\n- The \"Buckets part 2\" notebook prompts you to enter your AWS Account ID. It can be found at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) in the \"Account Identifiers\" section.\n- The \"Objects part 3, restoration\" notebook requires a bucket with archived object inside. As there is no way to immediately archive an object, we require the user to prepare such bucket. You will be prompted to enter name of the bucked and key of the archived object. See [Object Archival (Transition Objects to the GLACIER Storage Class)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-archival.html) for

For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).\n\n#Considerations\n\n- In order to run this notebooks you will need an Amazon S3 account. Each notebook prompts you to enter your Access Key and Secret Key. These credentials can be found at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) in the section named \"Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)\".\n- The \"Buckets part 2\" notebook prompts you to enter your AWS Account ID. It can be found at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) in the \"Account Identifiers\" section.\n- The \"Objects part 3, restoration\" notebook requires a bucket with archived object inside. As there is no way to immediately archive an object, we require the user to prepare such bucket. You will be prompted to enter name of the bucked and key of the archived object. See [Object Archival (Transition Objects to the GLACIER Storage Class)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-archival.html) for details.\n","filePath":"portal/amazonS3Services/notebookServices.md","repo":"AmazonS3"},{"path":"/virtual/AmazonS3/resourceTypes/base-object-resource.raml","content":"#%RAML 0.8\r\n---\r\nusage: |\r\n  Use this type for working with object's operations.\r\ndescription: |\r\n  This is extented resource type for resources involved in operation with object.\r\n  Inherits base resource and contains additonal headers\r\ntype: baseResource\r\nget?:\r\n  headers: &commonHeaders\r\n    Range:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Downloads the specified range bytes of an object.\r\n      type: string\r\n    If-Modified-Since:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).\r\n      type: string\r\n    If-Unmodified-Since:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).\r\n      type: string\r\n    If-Match:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).\r\n      type: string\r\n    If-None-Match:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).\r\n      type: string\r\n  # responses:\r\n  #   headers:\r\n  #     x-amz-expiration:\r\n  #       description: |\r\n  #         If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header.\r\n  #         It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key value pairs providing object expiration information.\r\n  #         The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.\r\n  #       type: string\r\n  #     x-amz-server-side-encryption:\r\n  #       description: |\r\n  #         If the object is stored using server-side encryption, response includes this header with value of the\r\n  #         encryption algorithm used.\r\n  #       type: string\r\n  #       enum: [AES256]\r\n  #     x-amz-restore:\r\n  #       description: |\r\n  #         Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the restored object copy.\r\n  #       type: string\r\n  #     x-amz-website-redirect-location:\r\n  #       description: |\r\n  #         When a bucket is configured as a website, you can set this metadata on the object so the website endpoint will\r\n  #         evaluate the request for the object as a 301 redirect to another object in the same bucket or an external URL.\r\n  #       type: string\r\nput?:\r\n  headers:\r\n    Cache-Control:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain\r\n      type: string\r\n    Content-Disposition:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Specifies presentational information for the object.\r\n      type: string\r\n    Content-Encoding:\r\n      description: |\r\n        Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and\r\n        thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.\r\n      type: string\r\n    Content-Length:\r\n      description: |\r\n        The size of the object, in bytes.\r\n      type: string\r\n    Content-MD5:\r\n      description: |\r\n        The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864.
